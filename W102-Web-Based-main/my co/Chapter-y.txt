classname---H2---Electricity supply 
classname---p---Reducing emissions from electricity generation and then using low-carbon electricity to power the economy is a central part of reaching Net Zero. Sector emissions have fallen rapidly over the last decade, and the Government has made a strong commitment to fully decarbonise the sector by 2035. The key challenge is now to ensure that these ambitions are delivered on, and that available lowcarbon electricity can be fully utilised and is sufficiently reliable and resilient. 
classname---H3---Our key messages are:
classname---H4---Emissions.
list---ul---Largely due to a combination of nuclear outages and exceptionally low windspeeds, emissions from electricity generation rose by 10% in 2021 compared to 2020 levels. With coal now all but removed, this highlights the need to continue the rapid expansion of zero-carbon generation and develop flexible low-carbon alternatives to gas.
classname---H4---Policy progress.
list---ul---In the past year the Government has committed to electricity generation being 95% low-carbon by 2030 and fully decarbonised by 2035. It has also made stretching commitments to increase low-carbon capacity from renewables and nuclear, although these have some delivery risks. Overall, credible plans are in place for over half the emissions reduction required in 2035.
classname---H4---Recommendations and next steps.
classname---p---The overriding challenge is now to ensure that the Government’s ambitions are delivered.
list---ul---A key gap in comparison to other sectors (e.g. heat and buildings, transport) is the absence of an overarching delivery plan or strategy. This would improve visibility and confidence for private sector investors and should be developed as a priority. It should set out the Government’s approach and the requirements for a fully decarbonised, resilient electricity system by 2035.!!!Key enablers will also need to be tackled, including ensuring electricity market arrangements are fit for a low-carbon system, that both onshore and offshore network capacity and access is in place to support increasing electrification of the economy, and that potential supply-chain bottlenecks are addressed to avoid delaying investment. !!!The Committee will publish a report later in 2022 setting out how a decarbonised and resilient electricity system could be delivered.
classname---H2---Emissions trends and drivers
classname---p---In 2021 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity generation represented 11% of total UK GHG emissions. The vast majority of these emissions were from gasfired power stations (Figure 6.1). Emissions increased by 10% in 2021 compared to 2020, to 48.3 MtCO2e (Figure 6.1).
list---ol---This means emissions are tracking substantially (15 MtCO2e, 44%) above the Government’s Net Zero Strategy pathway for 2021 (Figure 6.2). !!!Emissions remain 8% below pre-pandemic (2019) levels, 69% below 2010 levels, and 76% below 1990 levels, reflecting the almost complete removal of coal generation from the electricity system during the 2010s.
classname---p---The increase in 2021 emissions reflects both rising demand in response to the easing of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the carbonintensity of generation:
classname---H3---Electricity demand.
classname---p---Demand rose by 2% to 285 TWh in 2021, but was still 4% lower than pre-pandemic levels. This rebound was primarily driven by higher industrial demand (Figure 6.3).
list---ul---Industrial electricity demand increased by 4%, while commercial and residential demand both increased by 1% relative to 2020 levels. !!!Overall electricity demand remained below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the continuation of restrictions during 2021. Residential demand was 5% higher and commercial and industrial demand 10% and 6% lower than in 2019, respectively, reflecting the higher prevalence of working from home during the pandemic. !!!In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, residential electricity demand was 4% and 7% respectively lower than in the equivalent periods in 2020. This may be a consequence of increased electricity prices resulting from higher gas prices, combined with milder weather and some relaxation of lockdown restrictions during parts of that period. 
classname---H3---Electricity demand.
classname---p---Emissions intensity rose by 12% in 2021 to 200 gCO2/kWh. Low-carbon generation was 9% lower than in 2020 due to low windspeeds and outages at nuclear plants. Consequently, gas generation and imports rose to compensate for this, increasing emissions.
classname---H4---Low-carbon generation reduced by 9% in 2021.
classname---p---reduced by 9% in 2021.
list---ol---The lowest average windspeeds in a decade led to a 14% reduction in wind generation in 2021, despite a 5% increase in capacity. Consequently, the average offshore wind load factor fell to 37% compared to 46% in 2020, and the average onshore wind load factor fell to 23% compared to 28% in 2020. There is no clear evidence this is part of a longer-term trend (Figure 6.4), but we will continue to monitor this as part of our annual progress tracking.!!!There was also less sunshine in 2021 compared to 2020, causing a 6% reduction in solar generation. The average solar load factor fell to 10% compared to 11% in 2020.!!!Nuclear generation reduced by 9% in 2021, primarily due to plant outages. This is part of a continued decline in nuclear generation due to ageing of the UK reactor fleet.
classname---H4---Fossil fuel generation and imports.
classname---p---To compensate for lower renewable and nuclear generation, fossil fuel generation increased by 12% and imports by 37%. list---ol---Gas-fired generation rose by 12% in 2021. Coal generation also increased, by 15%, but remains only 2% of total supply. !!!Imports increased by 37%, although they still represent less than 10% of electricity supplied. New interconnectors were opened, including with Norway, increasing capacity from 5.0 GW to 7.4 GW. 
classname---p---Overall, over half of electricity generation in 2021 came from low-carbon sources, with the bulk of the remaining generation met by gas (Figure 6.5).
