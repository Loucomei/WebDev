Strengthened evidence on the impact of human activity on our planet has been
                    accompanied by sustained increases in global temperature and severe weather
                    events. Despite cooling effects from a La Ni√±a event in 2021, the past seven years
                    have been the warmest seven years on record.5
                    Global mean temperatures continue to rise due to continued global GHG
                    emissions. Despite calls for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic
                    and record levels of generation from renewable sources, fossil fuel usage
                    rebounded strongly in 2021. This has resulted in a rebound in emissions, with initial
                    estimates for 2021 suggesting that the pandemic-related drop in global GHG
                    emissions in 2020 has largely been regained.
